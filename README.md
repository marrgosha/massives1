<ins>Project description (tasks): </ins>

There is an array of 10 random integer numbers, which are scattered in it in random order.
For example int [] arr = new int[] {5, -3, 2, 1, 7, 11, 12, -4, 1, 10};
You need to output to the console:

1. the number of even numbers in the array
2. the number of odd numbers in the array
3. the number of prime numbers in the array
4. the sum of all numbers in the array
5. the difference between the sum of the numbers having an even index and the sum of the numbers having an odd index in the array
6. the number of 0's (how many times the number “0” occurs) in the array
